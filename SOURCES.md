# SDK integration point provenance

Every point where `canton_toolkit` touches `cantex_sdk` is listed here with the
source location it was verified against. Line numbers refer to the SDK at
commit cloned from `https://github.com/caviarnine/cantex_sdk`, file
`src/cantex_sdk/_sdk.py` (unless noted otherwise).

## Domain model field shapes (mirrored by `core/models.py`)

| Core model | Field(s) | SDK model → source |
|---|---|---|
| `Instrument(admin, id)` | `admin`, `id` | `InstrumentId` `_sdk.py:104-113` |
| `Pool(contract_id, token_a, token_b)` | all | `Pool` `_sdk.py:257-277`; list via `PoolsInfo.pools` `_sdk.py:280-297` |
| `Balance(instrument, symbol, name, unlocked, locked)` | `symbol`←`instrument_symbol`, `name`←`instrument_name`, `unlocked`←`unlocked_amount`, `locked`←`locked_amount` | `TokenBalance` `_sdk.py:121-158`; list via `AccountInfo.tokens` `_sdk.py:161-201` |
| `Quote.returned_amount / returned_instrument` | ←`SwapQuote.returned` (`QuoteLeg`) | `_sdk.py:422`, `QuoteLeg` `_sdk.py:300-315` |

## Exceptions (mapped in `venue.py` hierarchy)

| SDK exception | Mapped to | SDK source |
|---|---|---|
| `CantexAuthError` (401/403) | `VenueAuthError` | `_sdk.py:84-89` |
| `CantexAPIError`, `CantexTimeoutError`, `CantexError` | `VenueRequestError` | `_sdk.py:71-89` |

## Notes / judgment calls

- `swap()` maps onto the SDK's `swap_and_confirm` (not the fire-and-forget
  `swap`) so the adapter can return a typed `SwapResult`; the fire-and-forget
  `swap` (`_sdk.py:1816-1844`) returns an untyped `dict`.
- `transfer()` returns the SDK's raw submit `dict`; the SDK provides no typed
  model for transfer results, so no fields are invented.
- Default base URL follows the SDK class default (testnet, `_sdk.py:1286`).
  The example script defaults to mainnet (`api.cantex.io`, `examples/example.py:48`);
  the adapter deliberately defaults to testnet per the toolkit's scope.

# Reference DEX adapter (`venues/dexref.py`)

Upstream: [srikanth-bitdynamics/Canton-Dex-Reference-Implementation](https://github.com/srikanth-bitdynamics/Canton-Dex-Reference-Implementation),
`services/operator-backend` (no vendor SDK; the adapter speaks the HTTP API
directly). Verified against a live demo-mode backend + source on 2026-07-18.

## Endpoints consumed

| Adapter call | Endpoint | Upstream source |
|---|---|---|
| `connect()` | `GET /v1/context`, `GET /v1/status` | `http/index.ts` |
| `pools()` | `GET /v1/pools` | `http/index.ts`, shapes `types.ts` |
| `quote()` | `POST /v1/swaps/quote` | `http/index.ts:941`; NB request field `poolId` takes the pool **contract id** |
| `balances()` | `GET /v1/holdings?owner=` | `http/index.ts`; per-contract rows, aggregated client-side |
| `swap()` | `POST /v1/pools/swap/request` (only when the authorizer needs a spec) + `POST /v1/pools/swap` | `pool/index.ts:37-84` (inputs), `:345-454` (flow) |
| `transfer()` | none — venue has no transfer surface; always raises | — |

## Model mapping / judgment calls

- `Instrument(admin, id)` ← pool `admin` + `baseInstrumentId`/`quoteInstrumentId`
  (holdings rows carry `admin` + `instrumentId`). No instrument-metadata
  endpoint exists, so `Balance.symbol = Balance.name = instrument id`.
- `Quote`: venue returns only `outputAmount`. `trade_price` = out/in;
  `slippage` = 1 − realized/spot with spot from pool `reserves`;
  `fee_percentage` = `feeBps`/10000 (fraction, matching the Cantex
  convention); `estimated_time_seconds` = 0 (not provided).
- `SwapResult`: `amountOut` from the `PoolRules_Swap` result;
  `admin_fee_amount` = 0 and `liquidity_fee_amount` = input × fee fraction
  (pool fee accrues entirely to LPs, `dev-server.ts:115`); `market` =
  pool `poolId` (e.g. `BTC-USDC`).
- Amount strings are ≤10-dp fixed-point per `DECIMAL_RE`
  (`http/validate.ts:25`); party ids must be canonical
  `hint::hexfingerprint{8,}` unless the server runs with
  `DEX_ALLOW_BARE_PARTIES=1` (`http/validate.ts:38-49`).
- The swapper-side allocation is wallet-authored on this venue
  (`pool/index.ts:69-84`); the adapter delegates it to a pluggable
  `AllocationAuthorizer`. The in-memory demo mock ignores the allocation cid
  (`dev-server.ts:94-160`), so `DemoAllocationAuthorizer` supplies a
  synthetic one; a testnet authorizer will drive the wallet relay
  (`http/index.ts:655`, needs `DEX_DEV_WALLET_RELAY=1` + a real ledger).
- Errors: HTTP 401 → `VenueAuthError`; other 4xx/5xx and transport errors →
  `VenueRequestError`, carrying the server's `{code, error}` envelope.

# Ekiden adapter (`venues/ekiden.py`) — read-only market data

Perpetuals venue on Canton. No SDK is used: the gateway (`ekiden-gateway`,
Rust/Axum) is called directly over HTTP. Shapes below were captured from live
responses on the Canton testnet gateway `https://api.cnt.ekiden.fi` on
2026-07-27, **not** from the published OpenAPI document — see the caveat at the
bottom. **MainNet** (`https://api.ekiden.fi`, the adapter's default since 2026-10-03,
listed as "Production" at docs.ekiden.fi/api-reference/integration/configuration) serves
the same routes and payloads; `/api/v1/info` there reports validator
`canton-grpc.validator.cnm.ekiden.fi` and MainNet USDCx (`…12208115…`). Staging is `https://api.canton.ekiden.fi`; public WebSocket streams
exist at `wss://api.cnt.ekiden.fi/ws/public` and are not consumed yet.

Public market data needs no credentials. Trading requires an Ed25519-signed
session (`AUTHORIZE|<timestamp_ms>|<nonce>`) plus API keys, and a root-whitelist
surface exists (`/api/v1/authorize/whitelist/*`); none of that is implemented
here, so this adapter cannot place an order.

## Endpoints consumed

| Adapter method | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `connect()` | `GET /api/v1/info` | asserts `runtime_manifest_phase == "ready"` |
| `markets()` | `GET /api/v1/market/instruments-info` | no params; `{"list": [...]}` envelope |
| `tickers()` | `GET /api/v1/market/tickers` | optional `symbol`; returns all markets when omitted |
| `order_book()` | `GET /api/v1/market/orderbook` | `symbol` + `depth`; **`depth` ∈ {10, 50, 200} only** |
| `recent_trades()` | `GET /api/v1/market/recent-trade` | `symbol`, `limit`; rows use single-letter keys |
| `funding_history()` | `GET /api/v1/market/funding/history` | `symbol`, `limit` |

## Model mapping / judgment calls

- Perps have no pools and nothing to swap, so this implements the separate
  `MarketDataAdapter` interface rather than `VenueAdapter`, against new models
  (`Market`, `OrderBook`, `BookLevel`, `Trade`, `Ticker`, `FundingRate`).
- `Market` carries the constraints an order must satisfy: `tick_size` from
  `price_filter`, `min_order_size`/`size_step`/`min_notional` from
  `lot_size_filter`, `max_leverage` from `leverage_filter`.
- Book rows are bare `[price, size]` pairs under `result.b` / `result.a`;
  trade rows key on `i`/`s`/`S`/`v`/`p`/`seq`/`T`. `Trade.side` is the
  aggressor's side.
- All amounts are decimal strings parsed exactly; funding rates arrive with up
  to 28 significant digits, so nothing may pass through a float.
- Timestamps are epoch milliseconds, surfaced as timezone-aware UTC datetimes.
- `OrderBook.mid_price` / `.spread` return `None` on a one-sided book, which is
  a real state here (the CC book had zero offers on 2026-07-27 11:22 UTC after
  a run of buys).

## Venue quirks the adapter absorbs

- **`depth` is an undeclared enum.** Only 10/50/200 are accepted; the OpenAPI
  parameter carries no schema. The adapter rejects other values before the
  request.
- **Query-string rejections come back as plain text**, not the JSON error
  envelope every other route uses, so the error mapper handles both.
- **An empty book side is reported as `"0"`/`"0"` in the ticker's
  `best_ask_price`/`best_ask_size`**, not as null. Passed through, a caller
  reads a best ask of zero as a real price. `_top()` maps non-positive
  price-or-size to `None`.
- **The published `api-reference/openapi.json` does not parse** — trailing
  comma after the staging server entry — so client generation from it fails at
  step one.
- `GET /api/v1/info` reports the Canton validator under a field named
  `aptos_network`, left over from their migration off Aptos.

# Tradecraft adapter (`venues/tradecraft.py`) — read-only spot AMM

Constant-product AMM on Canton **mainnet**, run by Obsidian Systems
(`tradecraft.validator.dev.canton.obsidian.systems` serves its devnet). No SDK
exists; the public HTTP API is called directly. Shapes below were captured from
live responses against `https://api.tradecraft.fi/v1` on **2026-08-11**, and
cross-checked against the published OpenAPI fragments in the docs export
(`docs.tradecraft.fi/llms-full.txt`) and the DAR integration guide v1.1.13.

Reading and pricing need no credentials. Orders settle by exercising Daml
choices on the venue's own package (`AMMRules_CreateSwapOrder` and friends),
which needs a validator node, a party of ours, and the package itself, which
the docs say is available on request. None of that is implemented, so this
adapter implements the read-only `PoolDataAdapter` interface and cannot place
an order.

## Endpoints consumed

| Adapter method | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `connect()` | `GET /health` | asserts `status == "ok"` |
| `pool_states()` | `GET /pools` | `{"pools": [...]}`; reserves, LP supply, both fee constants, 24h yield |
| `pools()` | `GET /tokenA/{a}/{b}`, `GET /tokenB/{a}/{b}` | resolves symbols to Canton instruments, cached per symbol |
| `inspect()` | `GET /inspect/{a}/{b}` | live reserves, `k`, `unclaimed_operator_fees`, `updated_at` |
| `fees()` | `GET /feeAmount/{a}/{b}` | fractions here, percents on `/pools` |
| `quote_symbols()` | `GET /quoteForFixedInput/{a}/{b}?givingAmount=` | the one route family that honours path order |
| `quote_for_output()` | `GET /quoteForFixedOutput/{a}/{b}?gettingAmount=` | exact inverse of the above |
| `liquidity_deposit_quote()` | `GET /quoteLPDeposit/{a}/{b}` | `instrument1Amount`, `instrument2Amount` |
| `liquidity_withdrawal_quote()` | `GET /quoteLPWithdrawal/{a}/{b}` | `lpTokenAmount` |
| `pool_yield()` / `pool_volume_usd()` | `GET /yield/{a}/{b}`, `GET /volume/{a}/{b}` | keyed by lookback (`1h`, `1d`, `7d`, `14d`, `30d`) |
| `yield_history()` / `volume_history()` | `GET /yield_history`, `GET /volume_history` | `window`; **different vocabularies per route** |

Not consumed: `GET /ammid` (the id is `lp_token_name`), `GET /lpToken`,
`GET /ratio` (see below), `GET /disclosures` and `POST /vault-holdings` (write
path only).

## The fee model, measured

The API publishes two constants per pool — an LP fee and an operator fee,
0.2% + 0.1% on 15 of the 23 pools. The engine charges **half their sum on each
leg**: the input is netted by `(lp + op) / 2`, and so is the output. Realized
fee is therefore `1 - (1 - t/2)²`, slightly under the published `t`
(0.299775% where 0.3% is advertised).

This is a measurement, not a reading of their source: `swap_output()` is fitted
to nothing and `scripts/tradecraft_market_smoke.py` prices **45 of 45
directions across all 23 pools** and reproduces the venue's own quote to
~1e-16 relative, which is float64's own precision. A single fee on one leg does
not fit (it is off by ~2e-6 relative, well outside that).

## Venue quirks the adapter absorbs

- **Path order is honoured by the quote routes and silently ignored by
  everything else.** `/quoteForFixedInput/USDCx/CC` sells USDCx, but
  `/inspect`, `/ratio`, `/tokenA`, `/tokenB` and `/quoteLPDeposit` answer in
  the pool's canonical order however the path is written — no error, no hint.
  Sizing an LP deposit off the reversed path inverts the pair:
  `/quoteLPDeposit/USDCx/CC?instrument1Amount=1000` returns
  `instrument_1_to_deposit: 1000` meaning 1000 **CC**. The adapter orients
  every response by the `token_a_id`/`token_b_id` the venue returns, and
  `LiquidityQuote` is labelled by symbol rather than by position.
- **Symbol is not instrument id, for exactly one token.** Canton Coin is `CC`
  on every route and `Amulet` as an instrument — the same trap Cantex has.
  `quote()` translates instruments to symbols; `_symbol_for()` refuses rather
  than guesses.
- **The same two fee constants ship in two units**: `/pools` gives
  `lp_fee_percent: 0.2` (percent), `/feeAmount` gives `fee_amount: 0.002`
  (fraction) under a schema that calls it a percentage. Fractions everywhere
  here.
- **`/ratio`'s description is the inverse of its own formula** — "the price of
  token B expressed in token A (tokenB_holdings / tokenA_holdings)". The value
  follows the formula. Combined with the orientation quirk, the route is not
  worth calling: `PoolState.price(base, quote)` is computed from reserves.
- **The two history routes take different windows.** `yield_history` accepts
  hour/day/week/month/year, `volume_history` only hour/day/week, and the
  published spec declares hour/day/week for both. Rejected client-side.
- **Zero and negative amounts are quoted, not refused**: the venue answers
  `200 {"user_gets": 0}`. Guarded before the request goes out.
- **Amounts cross the wire as JSON numbers**, and eleven of the 69 numeric
  pool fields are already large enough that a float64 cannot step at the
  ledger's 1e-10 (worst: 18,273,526.46980026 HECTO, step 3.7e-9; `k` at
  4.69e12, step ~1e-3). Responses are parsed with `parse_float=Decimal` so the
  digits the venue sent are kept rather than round-tripped through a float a
  second time.
- **The published token enum is stale**: seven symbols declared, thirteen
  traded, so a client generated from the spec cannot reach FRXUSD.B, HECTO,
  TRKXRWA, USDM1, eXAG or eXAU. The adapter takes its token list from
  `/pools`, never from the spec.
- **An unknown path returns `text/plain`** while every documented error is the
  JSON envelope, so the error mapper handles both.
- `POST /vault-holdings`, required by step 5a of the venue's own DAR
  integration guide, is absent from the published OpenAPI document.

# Cantex public market data (`venues/cantex_public.py`)

No account and no key: these are Cantex's public routes, documented at
`https://docs.cantex.io/developers/public-api/`. Shapes verified against
`https://api.cantex.io` on 2026-10-02.

## Endpoints consumed

| Route | Used by | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/public/pools/state` | `pool_states`, `pools`, `quote` | reserves, `fee_rate`, `price` (token_b per token_a), `tvl_cc`, both instruments with symbols |
| `GET /v1/public/tokens/info` | `tokens` | every token with its `coingecko_id` (null when unpriceable) |
| `GET /v1/public/volume` | `volume` | trailing-24h `volume_cc`, `fees_cc`, `lp_fees_cc`, `swap_count` |
| `GET /v1/public/stats` | `stats` | daily CC volume series, active traders |
| `GET /v1/public/markets/info` | `markets` | market symbols, `source` (`cantex` or `external`), channel names |
| `GET /v1/public/coingecko/tickers` | `tickers` | per pair last price and 24h base/target volume (JSON numbers) |
| `wss://…/v1/ws/public`, `market.<SYMBOL>.candles.<PERIOD>` | `candles` | a snapshot of recent bars on subscribe; 500 hourly bars on 2026-10-02 |

## The pricing, measured

`quote()` prices locally: constant product with the fee on the input. Against
the authenticated `POST /v2/pools/quote` it agreed to the 10th decimal on
CC/USDCx and CBTC/CC at 100 and 10,000 CC, both directions (2026-10-02). The
authenticated quote adds a flat CC network fee (0.82–1.24 CC in those runs)
that `/pools/state` does not carry, so it is not in `quote()`. The public
`POST /v1/public/connect/quote` prices the Connect transfer-with-memo path
instead (0.25% fee, 2 CC network fee that day), so it is not used as the API
trader's price.

# Rocky adapter (`venues/rocky.py`) — read-only market data

Spot and perpetual order books on Canton. Public REST, Binance-compatible, no key:
`https://api.rocky.exchange/api/v3/*` (spot) and `/fapi/v1/*` (perps). Shapes below were
captured from live MainNet responses on 2026-10-03. DefiLlama's Rocky adapter reads the same
public routes.

| Method | Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `connect` / `markets` | `GET /exchangeInfo` | `symbols[]` with `PRICE_FILTER`, `LOT_SIZE`, `NOTIONAL` filters (spot); perps list `symbol`/`pair`/`baseAsset`/`quoteAsset` only |
| `tickers` | `GET /ticker/24hr` | `lastPrice`, `volume` (base), `quoteVolume`; `bidPrice`/`askPrice` are always `"0"`, so top of book is not taken from here |
| `order_book` | `GET /depth?symbol=&limit=` | `bids`/`asks` as `[price, qty]` strings; perps add `E`/`T` ms timestamps |
| `recent_trades` | `GET /trades?symbol=&limit=` | `id` (UUID), `price`, `qty`, `time` ms, `isBuyerMaker` |
| `funding_history` | `GET /fapi/v1/fundingRate` | answered 200 with an empty body on 2026-10-03 |

Spot symbols on 2026-10-03: CBTC-USDCX, CBTC-USDCB, CETH-USDCB, CETH-CBTC. Perps: BTCUSDT,
ETHUSDT, CCUSDT. `/fapi/v1/premiumIndex` was empty and `/fapi/v1/openInterest` returned `"0"`.

# OneSwap (`venues/oneswap.py`) and Pool Party (`venues/poolparty.py`) — reserves only

Both are AMMs that publish reserves without a key and no keyless quote route, so pools are priced
locally as constant product with the fee on the input (`venues/reserves.py`). Verified live on MainNet,
2026-10-03.

| Venue | Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OneSwap | `GET https://api.oneswap.cc/swapv2/api/rt/pools` | `assetX`/`assetY` with instrument `admin` + `id`; reserves as numbers and, under `accounting`, as decimal strings (used); `feeBps` 30 |
| OneSwap | `GET /api/rt/tokens` | symbol, admin, id, registry URL |
| Pool Party | `GET https://api-mainnet.cantonwallet.com/canton/pool-party/public/v1/tvl` | `pools: {"<idA>-<idB>": {id: reserve}}`; ids only, no issuer; empty pools listed |
| Pool Party | `GET …/volume?period=24h|7d` | `perPool[name].volume` per token, in token units |

Fees: OneSwap's docs state "the pool's 0.30% swap fee" plus a per-swap network fee carved from the
input, "typically around $1.5–2"; the collector charges $1.75 per OneSwap swap in the scanner. Pool Party
publishes no fee or curve; 0.30% is CCTools' `feeRate` for every Send pool (third party). Quotes
(`POST /api/rt/pool/{id}/quote`) need an OneSwap `sk_live_` key and are not used.
