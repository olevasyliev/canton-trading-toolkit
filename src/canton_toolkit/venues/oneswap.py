"""OneSwap public market data — pools and reserves, no key.

OneSwap (Sats Terminal) runs constant-product pools on Canton with atomic DvP
settlement. ``GET /api/rt/pools`` and ``/api/rt/tokens`` are public; quotes
(``POST /api/rt/pool/{id}/quote``) and swaps need an ``sk_live_`` SDK key and
are not used here. Shapes were verified against ``https://api.oneswap.cc/swapv2``
on 2026-10-03; see SOURCES.md.

Venue-shape notes:

- Each pool lists ``assetX``/``assetY`` with the instrument admin and id, so
  pools match other venues' tokens exactly, by issuer.
- ``feeBps`` is the pool fee (30 on every pool on 2026-10-03; the docs call it
  "the pool's 0.30% swap fee"). On top, a per-swap network fee is carved from
  the input, "typically around $1.5–2" per the docs. It is not in the pool
  data and is NOT included in ``ReservePool.output``.
- Reserves come twice: as JSON numbers at the top level and as decimal strings
  under ``accounting``. The strings are used, so nothing is lost to floats.
- The docs do not spell out the curve; constant product with the fee on the
  input is assumed, which is what "price derived from the pool's own reserve
  ratio" and the quote's ``newReserveX``/``newReserveY`` fields suggest.
