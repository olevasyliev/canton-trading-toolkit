"""Canton Venues: one static page and one share card per venue we track live.

Hash routes cannot carry Open Graph tags, so every venue gets a real path,
``/venues/<slug>/``, with its own title, description and a 1200x630 card image
drawn from the same JSON the dashboard reads. The collector calls ``build`` after
each tick; it can also run alone against a saved API directory:

    python venue_pages.py --api /var/www/canton-venues/api/v1 --out /var/www/canton-venues

Every number comes from the collected data. The card's headline is the venue's
best fact, picked by a fixed rule (``leads`` builds the candidates, ``headline``
scores them): every fact that passes the honesty rules (a ranking it tops by at
least ``LEAD_MARGIN``, markets under ``MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD`` set aside, price
claims only after known network fees) is scored by how broad it is (``SCORE``:
the whole venue beats a count of trades, which beats one pool or one quote), and
the highest wins. A venue with no such fact gets a plain card. A venue's page,
card and share text never name another venue: the runner-up is kept in code and
the log, for the margin rule only.

Each category carries its scope (``CATEGORIES``): "on Canton" only where an
outside list confirms the ranking covers the chain (an internal check; the list
is never named in public copy). Any other ranking is stated plainly and the card
and page carry one line under it: "Based on the N Canton venues with public
market data" (``scope_line``).
