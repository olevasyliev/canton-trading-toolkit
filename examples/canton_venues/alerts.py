"""Alerts: rules over one tick's data, fired on crossing, with a cooldown.

An alert fires when a condition becomes true, not on every tick it stays true,
and the same alert stays quiet for ``COOLDOWN_S`` after firing. Thin pools are
skipped: a $6K pool off its peg is noise, not news.

Every alert goes to the site's feed. The Telegram channel gets only the loud
ones (``Alert.loud``, the ``LOUD_*`` bars), as they happen, at most
``CHANNEL_PER_DAY`` a UTC day: before 2026-10-08 it got every alert in 4-hour
batches, 300 in three and a half days, mostly $1-4 spreads.
