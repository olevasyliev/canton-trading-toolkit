"""Hourly record of best execution on Canton: for every pair, side and size, which venue returned the
most and by how much, before and after each venue's network fee.

One JSON line per sample in ``<dir>/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`` (UTC day), at most one sample an hour. It is
kept off the web root: the live snapshot is public (api/v1/execution.json), the series is ours. Each
line carries the fee table it was netted with, so a later fee correction can be told apart from a
change in the market.
