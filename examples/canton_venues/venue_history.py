"""Per-venue history for the venue pages, kept small in ``api/v1/venue_history.json``.

Two kinds of series, each labelled on the page with where it comes from and since when:

- ``daily``: one day's volume per point, from an outside record that already goes back. DefiLlama's
  Canton DEX overview carries a per-protocol daily breakdown (``totalDataChartBreakdown``, read
  2026-10-07) for Temple, Cantex, Rocky spot and Pool Party; Tradecraft's own ``/volume_history``
  route gives each pool's hourly volume for the last week, summed here into complete UTC days and
  kept as they accumulate. ``daily_total`` is the DefiLlama Canton total for each day, for shares.
- ``hourly``: our own reading of each venue's figures (spot volume, pool liquidity, perps volume,
  open interest), one sample an hour, from the day this file started. Nobody else publishes these.

Capped: ``KEEP_DAILY_DAYS`` of daily points and ``KEEP_HOURLY_S`` of hourly ones.
