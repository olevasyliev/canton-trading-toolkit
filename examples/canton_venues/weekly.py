"""Canton trading this week: one share card and page for the last seven finished UTC days.

    python weekly.py --api /var/www/canton-venues/api/v1 --out /var/www/canton-venues

Writes ``<out>/weekly/index.html`` (the latest week), ``<out>/weekly/<last day>/`` (a permalink per
period, so a post keeps its preview after the next week replaces the latest one), each with a
1200x630 ``card.png``, and ``<out>/api/v1/weekly.json`` with every number on them. A timer runs it
after midnight UTC (deploy/canton-venues-weekly.timer); no model is involved anywhere.

Each venue's volume for each UTC day comes from the first of these that has it:

1. The venue's own record of that exact day, read here and kept in ``weekly/days.json``:
   Temple ``/api/exchange/settled_volume`` (USD, one call per day: it refuses windows over 24 h),
   Cantex ``/v1/public/volume`` (CC, converted at the mean of our own CC price readings that day,
   ``history.json``, when they cover at least ``MIN_PRICE_HOURS`` of its hours), and Tradecraft's
   hourly ``/volume_history``, summed into complete UTC days by the collector (venue_history.py).
2. Our own reading: Rocky spot and Pool Party publish only a rolling 24-hour volume; the
   collector's first hourly reading after midnight UTC (within ``READING_WINDOW_S``) stands for
   the day that just closed. Recorded from 7 Oct 2026.
3. DefiLlama's Canton DEX record, per protocol per UTC day (``totalDataChartBreakdown``), only
   when neither of the above exists and only from a read made after the day closed (its running
   day is partial). Its point at time T covers [T, T + 1 day): checked 2026-10-07, its Temple point
   for 6 Oct ($36,118,149) is Temple's own figure for that day ($36,117,825). Credited on the page's
   notes, never on the card.

- The big number: the sum over the period for the venues with a figure on all seven days. A venue
  missing a day is left out and named on the page, never estimated. A zero counts as missing.
- Week on week: the same venues over the seven days before, only when each has all seven.
- Share by venue: each counted venue's seven-day sum over the total.
- Scope: "Canton DEX spot volume" only when every protocol on DefiLlama's Canton DEX list, on every
  day of the period, is a venue we count (its per-protocol figures add up to its Canton total, so
  none is missing); otherwise "Spot volume, Canton venues we read".

Left out because the data does not exist for a week: best execution (we keep a snapshot, not a
week of quotes), new markets listed (no market list from a week ago), perps (not spot) and OneSwap
(publishes no volume).

Before anything is overwritten the period's total goes through the publish guard
(publish_guard.py, state in ``weekly/published.json``): an implausible jump or stale data keeps the
last good card and page up.
